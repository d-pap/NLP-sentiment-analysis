# Using Sentiment Analysis to Improve Ad Targeting Strategies

## Introduction

Marketers today are rightfully obsessed with metrics, but amidst the sea of data, it's easy to overlook the things that aren’t easily quantifiable, like customers’ feelings and emotions. Yet, these intangible aspects can hold the key to understanding customer behavior and preferences. Enter sentiment analysis, a powerful tool that allows companies to tap into the emotional pulse of their audience, transforming abstract emotions into actionable insights.

- *Sentiment analysis is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information (Wikipedia).* 

In the digital age, social media platforms have become the new town square, a place where customers express their opinions and sentiments about brands and products. Being able to identify and categorize these opinions and determine attitudes towards a particular topic is what makes sentiment analysis so powerful. 

In this project, I will be showing how this powerful tool can be used to help companies understand their audience, improve their products, and enhance their advertising strategies. I will use a hypothetical problem statement to show how it can be used to solve real-world problems. 

## Problem Statement

Since a majority of the tweets in the dataset revolve around the gaming industry, I decided on the following premise to frame the business problem I am going to solve. The hypothetical premise is:

- *I work as a data scientist for a popular gaming company, let's say Valve, the creators of CS-GO. The company is looking to improve its ad targeting strategy to attract more players to CS-GO, particularly those who are currently playing similar games. The company has collected a large dataset of tweets mentioning CS-GO, its direct competitors, and various other entities. The tweets contain various sentiments about the entities, and the task is to use the data to improve the company's ad targeting strategy.*

To do this, my plan is to start off by doing some exploratory data analysis on the current dataset and identifying users that would be good to target for ads. Then, I am going to use this dataset to train and build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment of tweets. Once the model is completed, it can then be deployed and used on future tweets to develop and improve their ad targeting strategy.
